# Installation 

Note: 
To be rapid on implementation, Section B was separated than Section A.
Remove the Section A files from root directory when you check the Section B.

Place all the files from SECTION into server's root directory.

    - Run `db.sql` file. 
    - It creates database named 'subscriptiondb' a table named 'subscribers' and dumps the sample data into the table.
    - Set host name, user name and password for database within that directory: `/database/dbconfig.php`
    - You can visit `http://localhost`, `http://localhost/subscribers`, http://localhost/search
